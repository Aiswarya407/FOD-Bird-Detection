# Airport Runway Detection System

This project detects foreign objects and hazardous materials on airport runways using YOLOv8 and Flask.

## Features
✅ Detects birds, airplanes, and debris using COCO-trained YOLOv8.  
✅ Identifies materials like plastic, metal, and concrete with a custom-trained model.  
✅ Provides real-time alerts for detected hazards.  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  

2. Install dependencies:  

3. Run the application:  

4. Open your browser and visit:  
**`http://localhost:5000`**

## Future Improvements
- Implement email/SMS alerts for hazardous materials.
- Add support for IP cameras.
